# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
We used a variety of Machine Learning Techniques to conduct Sentiment Analysis on "Tweets." 
We attempt to categorize the Tweet's Polarity as either Positive or Negative. If a Tweet contains 
both Positive and Negative parts, the prevailing Sentiment should be chosen as the Final 
Classification.
